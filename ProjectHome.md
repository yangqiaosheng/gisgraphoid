[Gisgraphoid](http://www.gisgraphy.com/gisgraphoid.htm) is a part of the free opensource Gisgraphy project (as the [Gisgraphy address parser](http://www.free.fr/documentation/addressparser.htm) and the [gisgraphy geocoder](http://www.gisgraphy.com/)), It gives you the ability to do geocoding on your Android mobile or tab with the same Geocoder API as Google but with Gisgraphy(it includes the [server](http://www.gisgraphy.com) and the [client side](http://www.gisgraphy.com/gisgraphoid.htm)). Run on all Android versions, free, no Google API needed by the phone, no API key, no limit. You can display the result on Openstreetmap or Google maps (Google API key required). Gisgraphy geocoder can be used [when no geocoder is present](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Geocoder.html#isPresent()).

Gisgraphoid is packaged as a jar or an APKlib.
